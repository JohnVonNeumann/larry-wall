# larry-wall

### According to Larry Wall, the original author of the Perl programming language, there are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris

1. Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.
2. Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.
3. Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about.

## Steps to Use (Ubuntu Local):
1. sudo apt install git
2. git clone this repository into your preferred directory
3. cd into larry-wall directory
4. chmod +x pre_provision.sh
5. ./pre_provision.sh
6. ansible-playbook provision_me_like_one_of_your_french_girls.yml

## Steps to use (Ubuntu Remote):
1. Copy paste the `remote_pre_provision.sh` script, from the larry-wall repo into a `script.sh` file on the remote slave host.
2. $ chmod +x `script.sh`
3. $ ./script.sh
4. The host should now have SSH open, enabling you to use ansible to provision the slave host.

## Steps to Use (AWS)
1. aws configure
2. input your AWS creds
3. should be sweet to run the AWS modules now
4. Also much safer/cleaner than vaulting your creds

## IAM Role Documentation to use
* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html

## Problems encountered
* In order to use the playbooks, you need to install Ansible, but doing it "safely" ie running it in a virtualenv at user level, requires pulling a number of processes outside of ansible based roles, which sorta defeats the purpose. I'm now understanding why you use control hosts for provision/configuration lifecycles.

## Extra Steps Required After Provision
1. Add your new keys to git related sites.

## Tasks/modules to add when time comes up:
* aws_cli
* aws_cli autocompleter
* inspec (deb package install, won't simply go in the general apt install role)
## Things to Do.
* Refactor the basic_apt_installs role to pull "important" packages out from more "customisation" level installs, it's become kinda tainted, basic_apt_installs should be separate so other people can use it without also setting it up similar to my personal host. It should be more of a "critical system packages" install role.
* Go through the overall playbook/s and clean up the overall roles into a logical ordering so that things can be installed without errors, I would imagine some decent conditionals will do the job properly. 
* Go through the roles currently generated and make sure they're actually being called so installs are going through on first book, everytime.
